I am a second year PhD student at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, co-advised by [Benjamin Peherstorfer](https://cims.nyu.edu/~pehersto/) and [Antoine Cerfon](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~cerfon/).


My research interests lie in numerical analysis and scientific computing. Some specific areas include:
- Multifidelity methods for uncertainty quantification, with applications in computational physics
- Data-driven techniques to approximate solutions of differential equations
- Numerical methods for problems in plasma physics


<!-- I am a graduate student in the Research and Training Group (RTG) in Mathematical Modeling and Simulation. I am also an NDSEG Fellow. -->


You can reach me at **Law**[at]**cims.nyu.edu**, or at 504 Warren Weaver Hall.
