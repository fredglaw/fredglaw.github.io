I am a fifth year PhD student at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, co-advised by [Benjamin Peherstorfer](https://cims.nyu.edu/~pehersto/) and [Antoine Cerfon](https://www.math.nyu.edu/~cerfon/). I am a 2020 [DoD-NDSEG](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/) Fellow as well as a member of the [Research and Training Group (RTG) in Mathematical Modeling and Simulation](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/research/pages/research-and-training-group-mathematical-modeling-and-simulation/).

Prior to joining Courant I received a B.A. in applied mathematics and a B.A. in statistics from the University of California, Berkeley.

My research interests lie in numerical analysis and scientific computing. Some specific areas include:
- Multifidelity methods for uncertainty quantification, with applications in computational physics
- Data-driven techniques for building surrogate solutions of dynamical systems and differential equations.
- Numerical methods for problems in plasma physics

More information about me can be found in my [CV](https://fredglaw.github.io/assets/cv.pdf).

You can reach me at Law@cims.@nyu.edu, or at 504 Warren Weaver Hall.
